      {/* EXECUTIVE POSITIONING */}
      <section style={{ padding: "80px 20px", backgroundColor: "#ffffff" }}>
        <div style={{ maxWidth: 880, margin: "0 auto" }}>
          <h2>Executive Positioning</h2>
          <p>
            Spain occupies a structurally distinct position within European
            fertility regulation. Unlike neighboring jurisdictions that impose
            restrictions on donor frameworks, Spain permits anonymous egg and
            sperm donation under nationally regulated standards.
          </p>
          <p>
            This regulatory permissiveness — combined with advanced laboratory
            infrastructure and established cross-border patient pathways —
            creates measurable strategic advantages for specific patient
            profiles.

      {/* REGULATORY CONTEXT */}
      <section style={{ padding: "80px 20px" }}>
        <div style={{ maxWidth: 880, margin: "0 auto" }}>
          <h2>Regulatory Context Within Europe</h2>
          <p>
            Spain permits anonymous gamete donation, a position increasingly
            uncommon within the European Union. For intended parents prioritizing
            confidentiality or desiring broad donor availability, this
            asymmetry significantly reduces scarcity risk.
          </p>
          <p>
            Surrogacy, however, is not legally recognized within Spain. Families
            requiring gestational pathways must structure arrangements in
            alternative jurisdictions.

      {/* DONOR FRAMEWORK */}
      <section style={{ padding: "80px 20px", backgroundColor: "#ffffff" }}>
        <div style={{ maxWidth: 880, margin: "0 auto" }}>
          <h2>Donor Framework Implications</h2>
          <p>
            Anonymous donation materially affects long-term considerations
            related to identity disclosure, genetic history access, and
            cross-border recognition frameworks. While Spain’s model enhances
            operational efficiency and donor availability, families should
            evaluate future disclosure philosophies within their home
            jurisdiction.

      {/* COST INTERPRETATION */}
      <section style={{ padding: "80px 20px" }}>
        <div style={{ maxWidth: 880, margin: "0 auto" }}>
          <h2>Cost Structure in Strategic Context</h2>
          <p>
            Spain typically presents a mid-tier cost profile within global
            fertility markets. IVF cycles commonly range between €4,000–€7,000,
            with donor cycles extending higher depending on laboratory and
            genetic protocols.
          </p>
          <p>
            Relative to the United States, Spain may represent material cost
            efficiency. Relative to lower-cost jurisdictions such as India or
            Turkey, Spain trades price advantage for European regulatory
            stability and infrastructure consistency.

      {/* IDEAL PROFILE */}
      <section style={{ padding: "80px 20px", backgroundColor: "#ffffff" }}>
        <div style={{ maxWidth: 880, margin: "0 auto" }}>
          <h2>Ideal Candidate Profiles</h2>
          <p>
            Spain is particularly suitable for:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Intended parents requiring anonymous donor frameworks</li>
            <li>Patients prioritizing European regulatory standards</li>
            <li>Lesbian couples seeking ROPA treatment structures</li>
            <li>Families desiring reduced donor waiting periods</li>
          </ul>

      {/* LIMITATIONS */}
      <section style={{ padding: "80px 20px" }}>
        <div style={{ maxWidth: 880, margin: "0 auto" }}>
          <h2>Jurisdictional Limitations</h2>
          <p>
            Spain is not suitable for intended parents requiring gestational
            surrogacy within the same jurisdiction. Additionally, families who
            prioritize open donor identity models may find regulatory
            misalignment.

      {/* OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS */}
      <section style={{ padding: "80px 20px", backgroundColor: "#ffffff" }}>
        <div style={{ maxWidth: 880, margin: "0 auto" }}>
          <h2>Operational Considerations</h2>
          <p>
            Most IVF treatment cycles require a 7–14 day presence during
            stimulation and transfer phases. Major clinical hubs — including
            Barcelona and Madrid — offer strong transport connectivity and
            established medical accommodation infrastructure.
          </p>
          <p>
            Strategic planning should consider transfer timing, embryo storage
            frameworks, and post-transfer follow-up within the patient’s home
            jurisdiction.
