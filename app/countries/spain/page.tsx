      <section style={{ padding: "80px 20px", backgroundColor: "#ffffff" }}>
        <div style={{ maxWidth: 900, margin: "0 auto" }}>
          <h2>Strategic Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Spain is one of Europe’s most established fertility destinations, known for
            liberal donor anonymity laws, advanced laboratory standards, and strong
            infrastructure for international patients. It consistently attracts cross-border
            fertility seekers from across Europe, the Middle East, and North America.

      {/* LEGAL FRAMEWORK */}
      <section style={{ padding: "80px 20px" }}>
        <div style={{ maxWidth: 900, margin: "0 auto" }}>
          <h2>Legal & Regulatory Environment</h2>
          <p>
            Spain permits anonymous egg and sperm donation under national regulation.
            Surrogacy, however, is not legally recognized within Spain, requiring intended
            parents to explore international alternatives if surrogacy is required.
          </p>
          <p>
            Age limits, marital status requirements, and eligibility policies are defined
            under Spanish reproductive legislation, with access extended to single women
            and same-sex female couples.

      {/* COST STRUCTURE */}
      <section style={{ padding: "80px 20px", backgroundColor: "#ffffff" }}>
        <div style={{ maxWidth: 900, margin: "0 auto" }}>
          <h2>Cost Positioning</h2>
          <p>
            IVF cycles in Spain generally range from €4,000–€7,000 depending on clinic,
            medication protocols, and add-on procedures.
          </p>
          <p>
            Donor egg cycles typically range between €6,000–€10,000. Medication,
            storage, genetic screening, and additional laboratory services may increase
            overall expenditure.

      {/* CLINIC STANDARDS */}
      <section style={{ padding: "80px 20px" }}>
        <div style={{ maxWidth: 900, margin: "0 auto" }}>
          <h2>Clinical & Laboratory Standards</h2>
          <p>
            Spain maintains strong embryology standards, with many clinics operating
            advanced laboratory technology including blastocyst culture and genetic
            screening services. Accreditation norms are well established, though
            reporting transparency varies by institution.

        <div style={{ maxWidth: 900, margin: "0 auto" }}>
          <h2>International Access & Treatment Logistics</h2>
          <p>
            Spain offers accessible visa pathways for short-term medical stays within
            the Schengen zone. Most IVF treatments require a stay of 7–14 days per
            treatment cycle.
          </p>
          <p>
            Accommodation costs vary significantly by city, with Barcelona and Madrid
            reflecting higher premium pricing bands. Patients should evaluate proximity
            to clinics, post-transfer rest requirements, and follow-up coordination
            before travel planning.

        <div style={{ maxWidth: 900, margin: "0 auto" }}>
          <h2>Strategic Considerations</h2>
          <p>
            Intended parents should evaluate long-term donor anonymity implications,
            embryo storage policies, and cross-border legal recognition of treatment
            outcomes within their home jurisdiction.
