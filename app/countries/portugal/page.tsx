    question:
      "Why do international patients consider Portugal for fertility treatment?",
    answer:
      "Portugal is often considered for its structured regulatory environment, growing private fertility sector, European accessibility, and potential for coordinated cross-border care. Suitability depends on the patient’s medical profile, eligibility, donor requirements, budget, documentation, timeline, and travel constraints.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Does FertilityCareHub recommend specific fertility clinics in Portugal?",
    answer:
      "FertilityCareHub does not publish public best-clinic rankings or paid promotional lists. Private advisory may include a curated shortlist based on licensing, laboratory governance, communication, treatment transparency, costs, donor practices, and continuity-of-care requirements.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "How should fertility-clinic success rates in Portugal be evaluated?",
    answer:
      "Success rates should be reviewed by treatment type, age group, donor use, patient population, denominator, reporting period, and outcome endpoint. Patients should distinguish pregnancy rates from live-birth rates and ask whether results are reported per cycle started, retrieval, transfer, or cumulative treatment pathway.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What costs should be considered beyond a Portuguese clinic package price?",
    answer:
      "A complete estimate should include medication, preliminary testing, monitoring, donor services, laboratory procedures, freezing, storage, embryo transfer, additional consultations, travel, accommodation, local transportation, cancellation exposure, and possible repeat treatment.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Can FertilityCareHub compare Portugal with Spain or other European destinations?",
    answer:
      "Yes. FertilityCareHub provides structured comparisons across regulation, eligibility, donor pathways, clinical infrastructure, costs, logistics, documentation, and execution risk. A published Spain-versus-Portugal comparison is available, alongside additional European jurisdiction briefs.",
