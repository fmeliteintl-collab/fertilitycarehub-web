## 2) Strategic Objective
*Primary decision the client is trying to make:*  
{{One sentence. Example: “Select the most structurally viable jurisdiction for donor egg IVF within a 6-month timeline while minimizing regulatory risk.”}}

---

## 3) Jurisdiction Shortlist (2–3)
> Shortlisted based on structural viability, regulatory alignment, and execution feasibility given client constraints.

### Shortlist
1) *{{Jurisdiction A}}*  
2) *{{Jurisdiction B}}*  
3) *{{Jurisdiction C (optional)}}*

## 4) Pillar Risk Bands (Client-Facing)
*Legend:* Low / Moderate / High (qualitative banding)

| Jurisdiction | Regulatory Alignment | Donor / Governance | Clinical Infrastructure | Execution Risk |
|------------|----------------------|--------------------|-------------------------|----------------|
| {{A}}      | {{Low/Mod/High}}     | {{Low/Mod/High}}   | {{Low/Mod/High}}        | {{Low/Mod/High}} |
| {{B}}      | {{Low/Mod/High}}     | {{Low/Mod/High}}   | {{Low/Mod/High}}        | {{Low/Mod/High}} |
| {{C}}      | {{Low/Mod/High}}     | {{Low/Mod/High}}   | {{Low/Mod/High}}        | {{Low/Mod/High}} |

## 6) Primary Regulatory / Structural Flags (If Any)
> Regulatory failure kills the strategy — list these clearly.

- {{Flag 1}}  
- {{Flag 2}}  
- {{Flag 3}}  

---

## 7) Recommendation (Directional)
*Recommended direction:* {{Jurisdiction A or A/B conditional}}  

*Rationale (1–2 sentences):*  
{{}}

*Conditional logic:*  
- If {{variable}}, choose {{A}}.  
- If {{variable}}, choose {{B}}.

2) {{Action}}  
3) {{Action}}  

---

## 9) Upgrade Trigger (Tier 2 Fit)
Tier 2 is recommended if any of the following are true:
- Client requires *deep comparative modeling* across multiple jurisdictions.
- Complex donor/surrogacy governance variables exist.
- High execution constraints (timeline, travel cadence, documentation).
- Client needs a *documented execution roadmap*, readiness checklist, and structured risk brief.

*Tier 2 deliverables (high level):*
- Adaptive framework application, deeper comparative analysis, and execution roadmap.
